            <h3>Course Selection</h3>
            <p>For the architects of learning course, I was asked to choose a course that I regularly teach to apply the
                class concepts to. Although I am not the course lead, I chose <strong>CSE 170 - Technical
                    Teamwork</strong>. I previously made updates to this class with the permission of the course lead
                and wanted to continue the work I did previously.</p>
        </section>

            <h3>Course Vision Statement</h3>
            <p>"Technical Teamwork teaches you emotional intelligence and teamwork skills you need to function well at
                work with others who might not be like you."</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Course Revision Initial Goals</h3>
            <p>My goal is to more closely align activities and assignments to outcomes with the framework of emotional
                intelligence as the backdrop. The course council felt that some assignments could be better formulated.
                This also required better weekly outcomes which align to course outcomes.</p>
            <p>Specifically, each assignment can be traced back to one or more elements of emotional intelligence. Each
                assignment has a meaningful rubric which helps us know if the student met the weekly outcome.</p>
            <p>I will collaborate with the course council for CSE 170, as well as my teammates and instructors in the
                AoL class.</p>

            <h3>Course Revision Plan</h3>
            <h4>Timeline with major steps included:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Week 5-6:</strong> Identify Weekly Objectives that align with course objectives. Ensure
                    weekly objectives include the language of emotional intelligence.</li>
                <li><strong>Week 7-8:</strong> Audit weekly assignments and activities to determine if assignments
                    effectively meet weekly objectives. Identify alternative activities for weeks that are not in
                    alignment.</li>
                <li><strong>Week 9-10:</strong> Evaluate assignment rubrics to determine if adjustments are needed to
                    ensure alignment with emotional intelligence goals and outcomes.</li>
                <li><strong>Week 11-12:</strong> Holistic review of class adjustments and final review by course
                    council.</li>
            </ul>
